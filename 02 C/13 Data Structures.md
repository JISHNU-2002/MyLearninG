### Applications of Stack (LIFO)
- To convert some infix expression into its postfix equivalent, or prefix equivalent
- Expression evaluation
- Function call implementation
- Parsing in compiler design
- Parenthesis Balance Checking
- Track nested function calls
- Undo Button
### Applications of Queue (FIFO)
- Call Center phone systems to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free
- Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer
- Data getting transferred between the IO Buffers (Input Output Buffers)
- CPU scheduling and Disk scheduling
- Managing shared resources between various processes
- Job scheduling algorithms

## Linked List
- List Insertion and deletion is fast and less expensive
- Used for applications which do not need random access

- Random access is not allowed
- Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list
- Slow in accessing the elements in the worst case , if list is too large
### Applications of Linked Lists
- Used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc
- Can insert elements at the beginning and end of the list
- In Linked Lists we donâ€™t need to know the size in advance
