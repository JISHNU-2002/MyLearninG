### Structured Programming
- Emphasis on algorithm rather than data
- Programs divided into procedures
- Procedures are mostly independent
- eg : Pascal and C

### History of OOP Languages
- Simula (1962) and Smalltalk (1969)
- "C with Classes" in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup, became C++ in 1983
-  C++98 to C++17
- Java developed in 1995 by James Gosling

### Benefits of OOP
- Class concept for data and methods
- Reusability and dynamic-ness in code
- Secure data hiding
- Popular languages : C++, Java, Python, etc

### Applications of OOP
- Real-time systems, OORDBMS, AI, CAD/CAM, System Software, Office Automation, Neural Networks, Parallel Programming

### Difference between struct and class
- `struct` members are public by default
- `class` members are private by default

### Object Oriented Programming
- 5 Pillars of OOP
	1. Class & Object
		- Class defines the nature of an object, containing data and functions
		- Object is an instance of a class
	1. Abstraction
		- Simplifying complex real-world objects
		- Well-defined public interfaces for interaction
	2. Encapsulation
		-  Hiding implementation details
		- Attributes and behaviors kept together
	1. Inheritance
		- Derived class inherits from base class
		- Adds unique attributes and behaviors
	2. Polymorphism
		-  Ability to exist in multiple forms
		- Overridden behaviors across subclasses
